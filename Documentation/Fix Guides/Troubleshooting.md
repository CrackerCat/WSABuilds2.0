   ### Filing a Feedback Hub Report 
   
   I would very much recommend you to file a Feedback Hub report. Make sure you are logged into a Microsoft Account when filing a report. (You can only file a report using the official version)

   Instructions: (As shown by one of devs in WSA Development team at Microsoft)

   Also. After completing the report I would highly recommend you to open an issue on the WSA Github Repo (https://github.com/microsoft/WSA) with a link to your Feedback Hub report + full repro of the issue. This will help the dev team see the issue quicker.
   
   I know that its a hassle, but it ensures that it gets some eyes on the issue in the quickest possible way.
