## Issue: </br> Error 0x80073B17 when "Run.bat" is executed to install Windows Subystem for Android (WSA)
### Preface:
##### This issue is caused/ associated with the Language Resource creation step which has moved from being processed within the Linux Bash script to a Windows PowerShell script ``MakePri.ps1/MakePri.exe``. Hence this may be caused by ``MakePri.ps1`` failing to run, and the reason for your installation failure is that the content of ``resources.pri`` is incorrect.
